        Thank you for being interested in initiating a Traveling Nature
        Journal!<br />
        On this page, we will explain you its process, so you can have an
        estimation of how much effort may need to go in.<br />
        <br />
        1. The Journal: You will need to provide one <b>A5</b> (148 x 210mm or
        5-7/8 x 8-1/4 inches), blank notebook, with at least <b>30</b> sheets of
        paper in it.<br />
        <br />
        2. Include the title "<b
          >Botanical Encounter: Traveling Nature Journal</b
        >" on the Journal’s front cover, and
        <b>the journal's tracking number</b> on the cover's bottom right-hand
        side. You can further decorate the cover if you feel like to!
        <br />

          This is the Traveling Nature Journal No. 0 initiated by me. It costed
          around 1 Euro, and the whole process took me about 1 hour.

      </figure>
      <p class="initiate_step_3">
        3. Include both English and German contribution instructions in the
        notebook by printing them out on an A4 size paper (or two, if you want
        to print them on separate sheets of paper) and sticking it/ them to the
        inside of the notebook’s front cover.

        page. Feel free to add description about the theme or guidents for
        approaching this particular theme.

      <p class="initiate_step_5">
        5. After you are done with the journal's set up, please send us the
        photos (W to H ratio 3:4) of <b>the journal’s cover</b> and
        <b>its theme page</b>. We will add them to the Botanical Encounter’s
        website.
      </p>
      <p class="initiate_step_6">
        6. Follow the journal’s instruction (the one you printed out) to create
        the first plant drawing/ print. Please
        <b>remember to upload its photo to the Map of Botanical Encounters</b>!
