          <i>Botanical Encounter</i> is inspired by the 16 centry German
          natualist book Codex Kentmanus.<br />
          <br />
          The book contains one of the earliest collection of botanical arts. It
          consists of hundres of illustrations from physician Johannes Kentmann,
          prints by his son Theophil Kentmann, along with contributions by other
          artists and scholars through exchanges and collaborations.<br />
          <br />
          It is a book of art and science, celebrating the human-plant
          encounters, and a representation of knowledge exchange.<br />

          German physician Johannes Kentmann’s plant drawings illustrated the
          plants he encountered in Padua Botanical Garden during his study in
          Italy.<br />
          <br />
          There, Johannes met the plants he didn’t known before. At his time,
          they were rarely depicted in the north of the Alps, some of them were
          not even from Europe. They traveled to Italy through international
          trades.<br />
          <br />
          Encountering new plants, Johannes started to observe and, with his
          paint brushes, detaily document them. His arts become one of the
          earliest collection of botanical illustrations.

          On the other hand, Johannes’ son Theophil Kentmann chose to document
          his local plant acquaintances in Germany, with a new technique -- the
          natural self-printing.<br />
          <br />
          Plant parts were coloured with black soot or charcoal ink, then rubbed
          by hand onto a paper. The result prints were later coloured with
          verdigris solution and another pigments.
