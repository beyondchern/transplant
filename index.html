          <i>Botanical Encounter</i> is a collaborative mapping project inspired
          by the 16-century German naturalist book Codex Kentmanus.<br />
          <br />
          The book contains one of the earliest collections of botanical arts.
          It consists of hundreds of illustrations from physician Johannes
          Kentmann, prints by his son Theophil Kentmann, and contributions by
          many artists and scholars through exchanges and collaborations.<br />
          <br />
          It is a book of art and science, celebrating human-plant encounters
          and representing knowledge exchange.<br />

          German physician Johannes Kentmann’s plant drawings, illustrate the
          plants he encountered in Padua Botanical Garden during his study in
          Italy.<br />
          <br />
          There, Johannes met the plants he didn’t know before. At his time,
          they were rarely depicted in the north of the Alps. Some of them were
          not even from Europe. They traveled to Italy through international
          trade.<br />
          <br />
          Meeting these new plants, Johannes started to observe and, with his
          paintbrushes, document them in detail. His arts become one of the
          earliest collections of botanical illustrations.<br />

          On the other hand, Johannes’ son Theophil Kentmann chose to document
          his local plant acquaintances in Germany with a new technique --
          natural self-printing (Naturselbstdruck).<br />
          <br />
          Plant parts were colored with black soot or charcoal ink, then rubbed
          by hand onto a paper. The result prints were later colored with
          verdigris solution and other pigments.<br />
