        <i>Botanical Encounter</i> is inspired by the 16 centry German natualist
        book Codex Kentmanus.<br />
        <br />
        The book contains one of the earliest collection of botanical arts. It
        consists of hundres of illustrations from physician Johannes Kentmann,
        prints by his son Theophil Kentmann, along with contributions by other
        artists and scholars through exchanges and collaborations.<br />
        <br />
        It is a book of art and science, celebrating the human-plant encounters,
        and a representation of knowledge exchange.

        German physician Johannes Kentmann’s plant drawings illustrated the
        plants he encountered in Padua Botanical Garden during his study in
        Italy.<br />
        <br />
        There, Johannes met the plants he didn’t known before. At his time, they
        were rarely depicted in the north of the Alps, some of them were not
        even from Europe. They traveled to Italy through international
        trades.<br />
        <br />
        Encountering new plants, Johannes started to observe and, with his paint
        brushes, detaily document them. His arts become one of the earliest
        collection of botanical illustrations.

        On the other hand, Johannes’ son Theophil Kentmann chose to document his
        local plant acquaintances in Germany, with a new technique -- the
        natural self-printing.<br />
        <br />
        Plant parts were coloured with black soot or charcoal ink, then rubbed
        by hand onto a paper. The result prints were later coloured with
        verdigris solution and another pigments.
