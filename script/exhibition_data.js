    exhib_description:
      "A garage is often more than just a storage space. It can be a refuge from the daily routine, a place where likeminded people get together in the enjoyment of making and tinkering. We found inspiration in this garage spirit and thus use a garage as headquarter of our art exhibition project. The garage is a space where you could come by, look at art, collect inspiration and if you like join us in making artistic projects together with international artists.",
