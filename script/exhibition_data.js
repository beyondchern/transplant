      "A garage is often more than just a storage space. It can be a refuge from the daily routine, a place where likeminded people get together in the enjoyment of making and tinkering. We found inspiration in this garage spirit and thus use a garage as headquarter of our art exhibition project. The garage is a space where you could come by, look at art, collect inspiration and if you like join us in making artistic projects together with international artists.",

      "As part of the Botanical Encounter project, we had a workshop with international students and scholars in cooperation with our partner, the University of Montana (UM) Global Engagement Office and an open workshop in the garden of the sustainability project UM FLAT. Next to drawing plants, we explored the technique of nature printing that was used in part in 'the Codex Kentmanus'. For this purpose, we made a simple ink from soot, egg yolk and alcohol.",
