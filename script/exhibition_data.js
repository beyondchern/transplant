      "A garage is often more than just a storage space. It can be a refuge from the daily routine, a place where likeminded people get together in the enjoyment of making and tinkering. We found inspiration in this garage spirit and thus use a garage as headquarter of our art exhibition project. The garage is a space where you could come by, look at art, collect inspiration and if you like join us in making artistic projects together with international artists.",

Next to drawing plants, we explored the technique of nature printing that was used in part in 'the Codex Kentmanus'. For this purpose, we made a simple ink from soot, egg yolk and alcohol.",
