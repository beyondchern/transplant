Therefore, we created two types of modern alcoholic drinks with sexual enhancement herbs. The first one is a reconstructed mulled wine with \u6deb\u7f8a\u970d, \u9396\u967d, and \u4e94\u5473\u5b50.

The city government thought this will make them look like they have been accomplishing projects. However, because the blackboard trees grow fast, they are also easy to break. For me, the tree becomes the symbol of fast development at all costs. Nevertheless, I somehow like the smell of its flowers (many people hate it, though). They always bloom around winter and remind me of festive mood. I have not smelled it after I moved out of the city. My mom tells me every year when the smell is back, and tells me she miss me :)",

I have known and liked them from childhood, because they grew back reliably - after every winter, as an offer from nature, for free enjoyment for everyone. Daisies form a family, a group with common aims. However, each individual flower is distinguished form the others in terms of color, shape, position, size and orientation. All members of the group are united by the earth as the basis of their being. A single daisy looks helpless, but together as a group, these small creatures appear strong. I also like daisies because they keep coming back no matter how often you mow them down. They cannot be driven away - luckily. Lots of individual flowers and yet they form a community, persistently carry on, like so many grassroots movements ...... That is their secret and their strength .... Yes, when I think about it, daisies are my favorite flowers.",

It is so Taiwanese that I only know its name in Taiwanese, rather than in Mandarin (It is called "big-head veggie," by the way. )\nI was surprised when I saw them in german supermarkets and even more surprised when a German asked me if I ever had kohlrabi before, in a way that he thought only Germans eat kohlrabi.\nMaybe kohlrabi is just an everywhere-specific veggie :D',
